# gravity-lines
Creates D3.js data visualization which takes data and puts it on a line graph. Each dot has a "gravity" to the line graph and when the user hovers over the
dots the id of that dot is shown underneath. 

User can add different data to the graph by altering the d3.csv() function in the index.js which loads from the data.csv. 
User can use a different .csv file as long as they modify dr.csv to include it.

to start the project; install python3, open your terminal and enter python3 -m http.server
this will start a python server which will start the web service. Type localhost:8000 in browser to see the graph.
